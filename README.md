# file-directory
A website I use to access some files on my home server.
It lists all files in the `files` directory and those that have the extension `.private` will be password protected.

It's convenient to have some software stored here and accessible from any machine instantly. 
For example some anti-malware software if you're often helping people clean their PCs,
or some archiving utility.

The password protection is only so that automated services don't find download links on my website that could lead to it getting marked as a pirating resource.
